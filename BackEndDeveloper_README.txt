Files Written by Me:
--------------------
Backend.java
- This file is the blueprint for creating a backend object. It interacts with the data
wrangler's code by implementing their MovieInterface(s) and interacts with the front end
by executing commands 

TestBackend.java 
- This file tests the methods within the backend class. It contains 5 boolean methods that 
return true/false based on the results of the tests correlated with each method in the Backend class
[I wrote the last 2 methods in TestBackend.java and made some changes with formatting].
 
Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
I organized a few team meetings within our team Discord group. I facilitated conversation and 
productivity by sharing ideas and corrections for the code.
