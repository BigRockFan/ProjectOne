Movie.java
ReadDataSet.java

Movie.java is responsible for constructing a Movie Object. It has a title, year, genres, director, description, and average rating. It has a vital role in helping the MovieDataReader class work. The MovieDataReader class takes in a CSV file and formats it into Movie objects depending on the information held in the columns of the CSV file.

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
I assisted the frontend developed a little bit when implementing the backend class. I also communicated to the others about deadlines and assisting each other.

I used a stackOverflow solution to parsing through a csv file looking for commas and ignoring quotations between them. The website link is in the file specification for the MovieDataReader class.
